# Exploring-British-Airways-Reviews-with-an-Interactive-Dashboard
This project analyzes British Airways customer reviews using an interactive Tableau dashboard to uncover trends in passenger experiences.
Key features include exploring ratings for cabin staff, food, entertainment, and seat comfort, comparing aircraft performance (e.g., Boeing 747-400 vs. A321), filtering by seat class, and providing geographical insights through a world map. It also highlights time-series trends, such as the significant drop in ratings during January 2021 due to the pandemic. The project helps passengers set expectations, aids airlines in identifying improvement areas, and showcases data visualization and analytical skills.
